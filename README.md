# Isabelle/Spartan

**Feb 2021: This project has been merged into [Isabelle/HoTT](https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT) and development here will cease.**

Dependent type theory for Isabelle.

### About
A minimal intensional dependent type theory object logic for Isabelle, supporting univalence and book HoTT.
This project aims to improve upon [Isabelle/HoTT](https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT), and will eventually be merged into that codebase.

An (outdated; new version forthcoming) initial system description is available here: [Isabelle/Spartan â€” A Dependent Type Theory Framework for Isabelle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09282)
