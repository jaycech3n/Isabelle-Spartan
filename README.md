# Dependent type theory for Isabelle

Intensional dependent type theory for Isabelle, supporting univalence and book HoTT.
This project aims to improve upon [Isabelle/HoTT](https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT), and will eventually be merged into that codebase.

- Current work is focused on:

  - Term elaboration
  - Better Isar integration with identity type reasoning
  - Automating the universe hierarchy

- [Why "spartan"?](http://math.andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Spartan-Type-Theory.pdf)
