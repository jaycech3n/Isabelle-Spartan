# Isabelle/Spartan

Dependent type theory for Isabelle.

### About
A minimal intensional dependent type theory object logic for Isabelle, supporting univalence and book HoTT.
This project aims to improve upon [Isabelle/HoTT](https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT), and will eventually be merged into that codebase.

An (outdated; new version forthcoming) initial system description is available here: [Isabelle/Spartan — A Dependent Type Theory Framework for Isabelle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09282)

[Why "spartan"?](http://math.andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Spartan-Type-Theory.pdf)

### To-do List
  - Tactics to automate propositional equality and homotopy rewriting — probably implement a general congruence tactic.
  - Universe level automation
